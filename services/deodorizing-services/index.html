                    <h3>How does the deodorizer work?</h3>
                    <p>Our enzyme-based formula uses natural bacteria that break down odor-causing compounds from urine, waste, and vomit. It doesn't just mask smells — it eliminates them at the source.</p>

                    <h3>How often should I have my yard deodorized?</h3>
                    <p>Monthly treatments work best, especially during warm weather when odors are strongest. We can apply it during your regular waste removal visits.</p>

                    <h3>Will it harm my grass or plants?</h3>
                    <p>No. The formula is eco-friendly and actually helps nourish your lawn while eliminating odors. It's safe for all grass types and garden plants.</p>

                    <h3>Can I add this to my existing service?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Deodorizing is an add-on service that pairs perfectly with weekly or bi-weekly waste removal. We apply it during your scheduled visits.</p>
