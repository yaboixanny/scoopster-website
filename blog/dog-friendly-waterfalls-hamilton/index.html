Some areas within conservation lands may have restrictions, so check trail signage when you arrive. The gorge areas below certain falls, like Albion Falls, are closed to everyone including dogs for safety reasons."

Felker's Falls is a close second with its well-maintained loop trail and moderate length. Both are good starting points if you're not sure how your dog handles trail hiking."

Most other waterfall trails in Hamilton have free parking, though lots can fill up quickly on weekends. Arrive early to secure a spot at popular locations like Albion Falls and Devil's Punchbowl."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Fall is arguably the best season—cooler temperatures keep dogs comfortable, crowds thin out after summer, and the foliage adds colour to every hike. Spring offers the most dramatic water flow from snowmelt but brings muddy trail conditions. Summer weekends are the busiest and hottest, making early morning visits essential. Winter can be beautiful when falls freeze, but icy trails require caution and may not be suitable for all dogs."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "It's generally not recommended. The pools at the base of falls often have slippery rocks, unpredictable currents, and cold water even in summer. Some areas are explicitly closed for swimming and wading. If your dog loves water, save it for a designated dog beach or calm section of a creek away from the falls themselves."
