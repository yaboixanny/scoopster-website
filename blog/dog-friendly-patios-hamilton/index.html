                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The Mule's back patio on James North has become a go-to for Hamilton dog owners, and for good reason. The spacious courtyard layout means you're not crammed next to other tables, giving your dog room to settle without tripping servers. Staff regularly bring out water bowls without being asked, and the shaded seating keeps things comfortable on hot summer afternoons.</p>
                <p>The menu leans into elevated Mexican street food—their tacos and elotes are local favourites. Grab a seat against the back wall for the most space, and come earlier in the evening before the dinner rush fills things up.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Ship has been a Hamilton institution for live music and cheap beer since 1985, and their patio carries that same laid-back, welcoming energy. Dogs fit right into the relaxed atmosphere here. The front patio gives you a prime people-watching spot on Augusta Street, while the back patio offers a quieter vibe if your dog prefers less foot traffic.</p>
                <p>This isn't the spot for a fancy dinner—think pub classics, solid burgers, and an impressive beer list. The crowd skews toward regulars who won't bat an eye at your dog sprawled under the table.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Radius brings a more upscale patio experience while still keeping things dog-friendly. Their sidewalk patio on James South puts you in the heart of the downtown restaurant scene, and the modern Canadian menu goes well beyond typical patio fare. It's a solid choice when you want something nicer but don't want to leave your dog at home.</p>
                <p>The patio is smaller than some others on this list, so larger dogs might feel a bit cramped during peak hours. Weekday lunches or early dinners tend to be less crowded and give you more breathing room.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Dog notes:</strong> Leashed dogs welcome, smaller patio—better for calm dogs</li>

                </div>
                <p>Hamilton's craft brewery scene keeps growing, and Grain & Grit stands out as one of the most dog-friendly options. Their outdoor space has plenty of room for dogs to lie comfortably while you work through a flight of their rotating taps. The industrial-chic atmosphere attracts a crowd that's generally very dog-positive.</p>
                <p>Food options rotate with visiting food trucks and pop-ups, so check their social media before heading over if you're counting on dinner. The beer selection alone makes it worth the visit—their hazy IPAs and sours have developed a loyal following.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Brain's narrow shotgun-style interior isn't ideal for dogs, but their back patio is a hidden gem for pet owners. The intimate courtyard space has a neighbourhood-bar feel that makes both you and your dog feel right at home. It's one of those spots where the bartenders know the regulars by name—and often know their dogs' names too.</p>
                <p>The menu keeps things simple with solid bar snacks and a well-curated drink list. It's not trying to be anything fancy, which is exactly why it works so well for a casual evening out with your pup.</p>

                <h2>Tips for Bringing Your Dog to Hamilton Patios</h2>
                <p>A few things to keep in mind before heading out. Under Ontario regulations, dogs are permitted on restaurant patios as long as there's no direct access to indoor food preparation or service areas—which is why many places route you around the side to their outdoor space. Always keep your dog leashed and close to your table, and bring a portable water bowl if you're not sure the patio provides them.</p>
                <p>Peak patio hours on weekends can get crowded and overstimulating for some dogs. If your pup tends toward anxious, aim for weekday visits or earlier time slots. And it probably goes without saying, but make sure your dog has done their business before you settle in—nobody wants to deal with that mid-meal.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3 style="color: var(--primary-green); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Are dogs allowed on restaurant patios in Hamilton?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act permits dogs on restaurant patios provided the outdoor area is separated from indoor spaces where food is prepared or served. Individual restaurants set their own policies, so it's always worth calling ahead if you're unsure—but the five spots listed above all actively welcome dogs.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--primary-green); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Do I need to bring water for my dog?</h3>
                <p>Most dog-friendly patios in Hamilton will bring out a water bowl if you ask, and several do so automatically. That said, bringing a collapsible travel bowl is never a bad idea, especially on hot days or if you're walking between spots.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--primary-green); margin-top: 1.5rem;">What's the best time to visit dog-friendly patios?</h3>
                <p>Weekday afternoons and early evenings tend to be the calmest, giving your dog more space and fewer distractions. Weekend brunch and dinner rushes can get hectic, which some dogs handle fine while others find stressful. Know your dog's temperament and plan accordingly.</p>
