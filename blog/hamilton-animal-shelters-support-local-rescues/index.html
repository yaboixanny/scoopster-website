          "@type": "Answer",

When you find an animal you're interested in, you'll complete an application covering your living situation, pet experience, and care plans. Staff or volunteers review applications and follow up with questions or next steps. The timeline varies—sometimes same-day adoptions happen, other times it takes a week or more for the full process."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Absolutely. Shelters need volunteers for dog walking, cat socialization, cleaning, administrative tasks, event support, transport, and more. Most organizations have formal volunteer programs with orientation and training. Time commitments range from a few hours monthly to regular weekly shifts depending on the role and your availability. Contact your preferred shelter to ask about current volunteer needs and how to get started."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The three biggest needs are monetary donations, foster homes, and volunteers—in roughly that order. Cash provides flexibility for emergency veterinary care and operational costs. Foster homes directly increase rescue capacity by opening spots for more animals. Volunteers keep daily operations running. Physical supply donations help but should match the shelter's current wish list to be useful."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Reputable shelters and rescues provide veterinary care before adoption, including spaying or neutering, vaccinations, microchipping, and treatment for any identified health issues. You'll receive documentation of this care. Shelters are transparent about known health conditions—if an animal has a chronic issue or special needs, you'll be informed during the adoption process."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "If you're in a situation where you can no longer care for a pet, contact the Hamilton/Burlington SPCA or Born Free Pet Shelter to ask about their intake process. Be prepared for an honest conversation about the animal's history, behaviour, and health. Surrender is sometimes the most responsible choice, and shelters understand that circumstances change."
